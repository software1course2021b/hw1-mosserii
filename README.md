Git submission instructions:
1. Fill in your TAU username and ID in the details.txt file.
2. Make sure you commit and push all your code.
3. Submit the link to your git repository via Moodle as assignment.txt

As written in the pdf, you need to copy-paste the following:

System.out.println("The input ("+x+", "+y+", "+z+") defines a valid triangle!");

System.out.println("The input ("+x+", "+y+", "+z+") does not define a valid triangle!");

System.out.println("The input ("+x+", "+y+", "+z+") defines a valid right triangle!");

System.out.println("Invalid input!");
